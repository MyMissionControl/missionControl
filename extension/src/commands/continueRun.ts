 * the card went quiet while `agents/*` worktrees and a moved `main` were still

 *   ABORT_NOOP_AT_BASE — main was already at base; nothing to rewind. Reverted.
 *   ABORT_SKIP_PUSHED  — origin/main is ahead of base, so abort DELIBERATELY left
 *                        history alone: the sprint's work is merged upstream and
 *                        kept. That is keep-done, the same word decideCancelOutcome
 *                        uses — calling it "cancelled" would claim a revert that
 *                        was never even attempted.

 * repo is in, so say so: `error` renders as a chip carrying errorMsg and leaves
