/**  Cross-repo parity: orches-drive (bash) writes it, MissionControl (TS) reads it.
 *
 *  WHY this file exists — "two surfaces, one kernel". The `.orches-*` files are a CONTRACT
 *  between two codebases that share no code: `orches-integrate.sh` writes them, this extension
 *  parses them. Each side has its own parser. Nothing today proves the two agree, and a
 *  disagreement is invisible: MC just silently shows a slightly different value than the drive
 *  is acting on. That already bit us once — a divergent model-id regex dropped `opus[1m]`
 *  for every worker, and the fix comment still sits at teamsModel.ts:224.
 *
 *  METHOD (repo convention, see the `mc-orches-dev-verify` skill): round-trip. Write with the
 *  REAL bash verb, read with the REAL TS parser, assert they agree. NOT hand-written fixture
 *  strings on both sides — that would only prove both match a string I invented, which is how
 *  you get two parsers that agree with the fixture and disagree with each other.
 *
 *  SCOPE: the pairs that exist today —
 *    (1) `.orches-state`  bash cmd_state_get      <-> TS parseStateValue
 *    (2) model id guard   bash cmd_worker_model   <-> TS isSafeModelId
 *
 *  This test SKIPS (loudly) when the skill isn't installed, so a clone without orches-drive
 *  still runs green — but it must never pass silently while the engine is present.
